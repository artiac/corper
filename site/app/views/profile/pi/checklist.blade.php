                <li>Make sure you use your own Thumbprint! Officials will check it in camp.</li>
                <li>Only register on the official Government portal. There are a lot of fake websites out there.</li>
                <li>Read the Corperlife <a href="http://www.corperlife.com/checklist-guide">Registration Checklist</a> checklist again! Also, tick-off things as you acquire them and have everything ready.</li>
                <li>Take a sealed, official transcript with you to Camp, it will save you stress.</li>
                <li>Get connections before going to Camp, find out if your Parents or Relatives know anyone who works with NYSC, this could really help the process and help you get everything done that day.</li>
                <li>You have been given enough time to register. Don’t wait to do it last minute. </li>
                <li>If you know anyone that lives in Abuja let them know you're coming, so that you have a place to stay if you can't finish registering that day. </li>
                <li>Make sure you upload ALL supporting documents in the online registration.</li>
                <li>Get a data plan on your smartphone so that if you need to scan and upload additional documents to the NYSC portal you can simply take a picture and upload straight from your phone… you wont have to enter that dreadful line.</li>
                <li>Get a Bank account setup and get an ATM card before camp!. You can use the ATM machines in camp and people can put money in your account in case you run out.</li>
                <li>Get a really good folder to keep all your important documents crisp and organised…. cause you will be taking them to camp and using them throughout your journey.</li>
                <li>Camp Registration is 3 Days, there is no need getting there early on the first day…. relax everyone will get khaki…. but don't go too late so you get a good place to sleep and someone to trade kit with (so that it fits).</li>
                <li>Print your call up letters before going to camp. There is a fee to obtain it.</li>
                <li>Don’t Laminate your Call-up letters… Officials need to sign/stamp it in camp.</li>
                <li>Take note of the day you have to get your call up letter, thats when you find what state/camp you are going to. Don’t miss it.</li>
                <li>Meet other people who are going to the same camp. The experience is sweeter with a friend.</li>

                 Camp begins with finding out where you will sleeping and receiving your kit. Before we continue, its important you understand a few things have changed recently, for one, foreign students now do their verification in camp rather than the tedious trip to Abuja also, you get your call up number in text or online. The Government has clearly made an effort to simplify the process but,it may take some time for those higher level changes to efficiently show at camp and local govt level. </p>
                 <p>Since verification and settling-in will be happening at the same time, our prediction is you will probably spend more than two days going through it all. If it proves to be otherwise, please let us know on our Facebook page and we will send the government an official corperlife™ commendation (we are serious). </p>
                  <p>Don’t.Stress.Yourself. Settling in will take a few days and camp won’t start till everyone is settled in, so just go with the flow, there will DEFINITELY be enough time to get yourself sorted out. As far as living goes, the bedrooms will be packed, the bathrooms can be below standard (degree varies by state),  there are also lots of boring lectures to attend and you WILL be woken up at 4:30ish by the sound of the almighty bugle, whistles  and shouting soldiers. That aside, camp is by far the most fun experience in NYSC and one worth remembering and sharing with friends.This is your chance to do it so don’t cheat yourself out of an amazing experience by skipping it. Camp is a great opportunity toMake new friends, relax and enjoy the freedom of being absolutely carefree for three weeks. It is essentially a government sponsored retreat.</p>
                 <p>Probably the greatest thing about camp is Mami market where you will (should) spend most of your time. Everyone that has been through camp knows anything is possible in Mami; friends, future spouses, groceries, laundry services, bukkas with correct food, tailors, barbers/hairdressers and even a video game arcade! At night, the Mami market basically transforms into a nightclub/bar with current music, drinks and all kinds of food (like shawarmas, suya, small chops, even cotton-candy). And you know what the best part is? Everything is offered at corper rates ….i.e dirt cheap.

</p>
                 <p>You will also experience some company sponsored competitions with the possibility of earning nice prizes, and if you’re lucky, your camp may even have a concert performed by a surprise big-name artist. During all this, many inter-platoon competitions, reminiscent of secondary school interhouse sports, will be going on. The Officials do a good job of making sure there are always things to do. 

</p>
                 <p>By the end of the 3 weeks you won’t be able to help but feel a bit sad about leaving. It’s like that last day in boarding school, you will miss the once hostile environment and all the people you are leaving. Hopefully you diligently collected contact details of all your camp friends, so keeping in touch wont b an issue. All in all, camp is a once-in-a-lifetime experience you really don't want to miss out on. So set your expectations low, make friends, learn, take lots of pictures and keep up with Corperlife™. </p>

                 If there is any part of the NYSC that teaches you humility and how to “kiss ass” it’s the serving phase better known as the PPA (Place of Primary Assignment). Your PPA s where you will be posted for the rest of your service year. It could be anywhere from a school to your local government office It all depends on what you got last day of Camp. The Serving phase usually involves couple things:-
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>CD/SAED Groups:- Pick one! either develop the community (CD) or develop yourself (SAED), you do these weekly. Dont forget to get your respective cards signed.</li>
                <li>Monthly General CDS:- Every Corper in the Local Government Gathers together on this day to listen to the LGIs words of wisdom and important announcements. We would recommend coming and listening, in fact, go as far as to giving the occasional nod of agreement because your dear LGi signs your card after.</li>
                <li>Monthly Clearance:- Done in first week of the month, you get a letter from your employer saying that you worked well for the month and you deserve to get paid. Without this you don't get allowee.. dont dull.</li>
                <li>Final Clearance:- As the name says It is the Last time you do clearance. So make sure you don't vex anyone before this day. They can really make life hard for you.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>“Exactly whose ass will I be kissing?” Did we hear you ask…. the answer is simple.. anyone who has to sign anything for you , especially your boss and your LGI, they have true power. It is very advisable to get into and stay in their good books. Try not to become “teachers pet” though as you might run the risk of being hated by fellow corpers. So Kiss-ass, make friends,  take loads of pics and build your NYSC story with CorperLIfe<sup>TM</sup>!</p>

                <li>Wear your kit when doing anything official (requires anyone to sign)</li>
                <li>Your Posting letter doesn't  necessarily mean you will serve there, you can be rejected. So if you like your posting go straight to the place to secure it! there are many more corpers competing for that position.</li>
                <li>It’s probably a good idea to take your Posting Letter straight to your PPA after camp. It would get that process out of the way and is your best bet to guarantee placement of your preference.</li>
                <li>Make friends with your LGI, thats one person you really want on you team. He/She can cover for you when/if you're wrong.</li>

At the time this overview was written (Oct 2014), the elaborate ceremony had been suspended to ensure the safety of corpers during civil unrest. It usually involves a passing out parade and speeches from prominent people in the state. Sounds boring right? there is really only two reasons to go for it, your certificate and friends . You get to see everyone you knew in camp and for most of them this will probably be the last time. So make sure you exchange each others contacts and hang out after! By making proper friends and helping each other in life you will all become more successful.</p>
              <p>So now that you're an ex-corper and have explored more of Nigeria you have probably noticed that  this country is filled with so many problems. The serving experience is meant to show you how much of a difference you can make in your youth. It is no longer enough to be a bystander and blame the government for all the problems. You are both people and the government, so it is up to you go out there and make things happen. Its time to graduate from being a corper to becoming an agent of change, a hero. Go and take those problems head-on, better yet see them as opportunities and solve them, for this is how great businesses are born.</p>
              <p> Enough of serious talk, we believe congratulations are in order!, if you took our advice and experienced the whole thing then some serious kudos to you, wear it as a badge of honour. You have more experience, made more friends and possible future connections thus gaining advantage that most of your peers won’t have. For those who purposefully skipped the NYSC experience we simply pray for courage to embrace future opportunities/challenges.</p>
              <p>In all your excitement please don't forget to make new ‘last minute’ friends, secure older ones, take loads of pics and  don’t forget to use the CorperLife™ career center. Now go forth and be great!!…. thanks for using CorperLIfe™.

                <li>Make sure your LGI signs all the days on your CD card before POP. This is when your friendship truly counts.</li>
                <li>Don't rush off after you get your certificate. Admit it,  you probably don't have anywhere else more important to be. treasure this moment and meet/greet people.</li>
                <li>Dont forget to collect the contact of interesting people you missed out on in camp… they could really prove useful in future.</li>
                <li>Celebrate your passing out with others, organise to hang out that same day… because once people take off the NYSC uniform, they put on the uniform of real life and won’t be so keen on hanging out.</li>
                <li>Use the career center to assist you in getting employed, seriously there is a lot of cool stuff there and its free. </li>
